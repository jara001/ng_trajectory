"""Borderlines penalizer.

Borderlines are sets of points on the borders between two adjacent
segments. We have borderlines for each segment and for each neighbour
(usually resulting into n * 2 arrays).

This penalizer detects all misplaced points. Each point is associated
with a borderline based upon its location -- e.g., points in between
selected points of segments #5 and #6 belong to borderline 5-6.

The penalty is calculated as maximum distance between invalid point
and points of the borderline.

Final penalty is the minimum of all of these distances.
