"""Profile criterion for fitness evaluation.

This criterion computes fitness value by simulating the vehicle
over the input path. There are various parameters to be set. But
mostly, we focus on a simple vehicle model and simple environment
interaction by friction coefficient, air density, etc.

Note: The parameters shown below are not synced with the algorithm
itself. Therefore, pay attention to any updates.
