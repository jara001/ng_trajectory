"""Model simulation according to the simplified model from Jazar [1].

This model is built on the 'Two-Wheel Planar Vehicle Dynamics'
equations of motion, page 143, with some addition assumptions.

Path profiling is done similarly to [2].

Note: The parameters shown below are not synced with the algorithm
itself. Therefore, pay attention to any updates.
