    - _Flood Fill_
        - Remove empty segments caused mostly by a selected group center outside of the valid area. This will probably change in the future.
- Track is plotted using lighter gray that is not in the standard palette. Therefore the colors should not overlap anymore.
- Algorithms are passed to the optimizer as modules not callables. Therefore it is possible to call other functions of the module as well.
- Figures created during the optimization are closed after saving.

### Fixed
- Selectors
    - _Curvature_
        - Track with identified turns is plotted with equal axes.

## 1.4.3 - 2021-11-12
### Changed
- Un-nested plot functions return created objects.

### Fixed
- Selectors: Resolve missing peaks for Curvature selector.
- Optimizers: Plot in Matryoshka only when it is allowed.
- Add PHONY target to Makefile to get around 'target is up-to-date'.
- Figure/pyplot wrappers are protected by `plot_only` decorator.

## 1.4.2 - 2021-11-09
### Added
- Makefile for building/installing/removing the package.
- Functions `reset()` and `resetAll()` to restore default states of parameters.
- Parameter 'reset' for `updateAll()` to automatically reset all parameters.
- Documentation exported from 'ng_help' to README.

### Fixed
- Segmentators: Flood_fill is no longer using old parameters when restarting the cascade.

## 1.4.1 - 2021-11-08
### Changed
- Selectors: Curvature selector no longer imports `pyplot` directly.
- 'ng_generate_data': Numpy is using Python builtin data types.

### Fixed
- Running the scripts without `matplotlib` no longer raises an exception.

## 1.4.0 - 2021-09-14
### Changed
- Optimizers: Matryoshka does not sort centerline before the selection (for segmentation).

## 1.3.0 - 2021-06-08
### Added
- Script 'ng_help' for showing help for the algorithms and their parameters.
- Utilizy 'parameter' for documented usage of parameters within the algorithms.

### Changed
- Use newly introduced ParameterList inside the algorithms, at least for the documentation.

## 1.2.2 - 2021-06-07
### Added
- Selectors: Curvature_sample selector (based on the Botta, 2012 article) by Ondra Benedikt.

### Changed
- Optimizers: Default number of workers is set to the number of logical processors.

## 1.2.1 - 2021-05-27
### Fixed
- 'ng_generate_data': Resampling method used when resizing the image is now explicitly set to 'PIL.Image.BILINEAR' as it was changed in an older version of Pillow package.
- 'ng_generate_data': Add `Pillow>=4.2.0` dependency to the setup file.

## 1.2.0 - 2021-05-27
### Added
- Optimizers: Final graph now contains invalid points as well (if present).
- Selectors: When using negative selection, leave the number of points on the selector.
- Selectors: Curvature selector by Ondra Benedikt.
- Script 'ng_generate_data' for generating numpy files for the algorithm from an image of the map.

### Changed
- Optimizers: Individual plotting is now forced on the main figure, instead of the global one.

## 1.1.1 - 2021-05-20
### Added
- Segmentators/Utils: `gridCompute()` to obtain square grid size of the points.
- Substitute not selected algorithms with a stub.
- Parameter `silent_stub` that suppresses errors when calling stub.

### Changed
- Selectors: Uniform selector now treats rotate as factor between two consecutive points, instead of rotating the whole path.

### Fixed
- Optimizers: Invalidity of points is compared to the specified or computed square grid size instead of a fixed value.
- Optimizers: Constant for penalty is no longer fixed and can be set via parameter `penalty`.

## 1.1.0 - 2021-05-18
### Added
- Automatic versioning of the package.
- Optimizers: Braghin supports parameter `path_reduction` for reducing the path prior to the interpolation.
- *Selectors* as a class of methods used for retrieving group centers from the centerline.
- Selectors: Uniform selector that supports selection rotation.
- Script 'ng_run' for invoking the algorithm directly from Terminal.

### Changed
- Optimizers: Braghin's parameters `endpoint_distance` and `endpoint_accuracy` are modifiable.
- Optimizers: Braghin during its transformation works with the full length of the centerline instead of a subset.

### Fixed
- Exception message is shown when parsing JSON fails.
- Variate run is using string formatting to properly display non-int variables.

## 1.0.0 - 2021-03-16
### Added
- Reimplementation of `ng_trajectory` as a standalone Python package.
